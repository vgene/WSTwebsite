                    <p>Q:For the three categories of web software technology we've just defined, you are asked to find out which category so-called "Netscape plug-in" technology belongs to. Please describe the basic idea of the technology, and give your reasoning on its position in the technology categories.
                    </p>

                    <div class="container well">
                    <p>A:</p>
                    <p>Netscape plug-in belongs to "Distributed Object Technology". Netscape is a browser, and Netscape Plug-in sits at browser side, it may interplay with server side, but its main job is interoperate with browser to provide content to users on the screen. Netscape plug-in was adopted by other browsers so that it is not only a part of Netscape browser but also a distributed platform. Specific plugins can interplay with Netscape and other browsers regardless of time, space, platform and awareness, which is a key feature of "Distributed Object Technology".

                    <p>Q: In a normal intercommunication between Web browser and Web Server, Web Server closes the network communication right after it sends back the document requested by the browser. Think about this statusless character of World Wide Web. Give some good points and bad points of it. Can a web server know exactly how many browsers are reading its document?

                        <p>A:</p>
                        <p>Good Points:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Less resource(time, space) is needed on server side.</li>
                            <li> Server implementation is much simplier.</li>
                            <li> Faster for one connection.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Bad Points:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Transimission overhead in each request.</li>
                            <li>Complex client/server interaction is very hard to implement (cookies and other technology are needed).</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            With traditional technologies, it is impossible for a web server to know exactly how many browsers are reading its document since the connection is lost once transmission is completed. However, there are Flash and other technologies which make it possible for server to know the exact number.
